# dmdb
Django Movie Database. Privacy-focused solution for tracking movies and TV shows.

## Motivation
As a privacy-minded computer user, I noticed a problem. To track their movies and TV shows, one must use either proprietary websites or unsightly text files. So, I created dmdb as a solution for privacy-minded powerusers and regular computer users alike to track their activity locally with a clean, open-source interface.

## How To Install
1. Install necessary modules: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set following vars in .env:
* `DEBUG`
* `SECRET_KEY`
* `DATABASE_URL`
3. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`
